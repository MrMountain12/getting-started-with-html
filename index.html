    <b>NOTES ON PROGRAMMING:</b><div><b>Inline</b></div><p>Inline codes are codes that deal with the text lines, like (b) or (strong) (<em>I'm using parentheses because if I use the actual signs, they won't show up)</em> </p>
<div>Examples of inline are: <b>(b) or (strong)</b> for bold, <em>(em)</em> for italics, <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VN3wMIvsAPKO9_9bkVfxqKaR4XOrg94-inKLrXwCfus/edit>(a)</a> and (img) for adding links and photos, and (br), which ends an existing line </div><br> <b> Block</b><br>
The other type of programming is Block, which forms an invisible box around the said text. The block htmls I've learned so far are (p),(form), and (div), which all start a new "paragraph"<br><br> <b> Extra data</b>
<br><form> There are also different types of tags, like (form) or (br). They are called Void tags, because they contain no closing tags.</form>Computers are considered stupid because coding has to be exact for them to cooperate. If the code isn't correct, the code will not show up correctly<br>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language<br><br>Caleb Monti, 7th grade
